# 42-Printf
Rebuilding the printf function using limited functions. All tests pass the norminette and the independent tester, as lovingly made through the suffering of Aidan!

I managed 100/100, and didn't do the bonuses as it would've required me to re-write...everything. Ugh. But maybe I'll try again someday for you all?

Attached below is my score! No Prints were harmed in the making of this Printf.
